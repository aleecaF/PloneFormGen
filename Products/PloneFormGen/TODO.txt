TODO.txt

When a field is deleted in the quick editor, a form field editor
briefly shows in the popup.

Strip out Plone 2.5 compat stuff

For merge of manca's branch: these things need checking/fixing

* conditions.py needs a code update
    - why is this a solo view class?
    - Too much work is done in template; this needs more code.
    - displayFields should return both fields and adapters in a single call
        in a tuple.
   
* fg_base_view_p3.cpt
    - why traversing to conditions?
    - after working, needs to be revisited for cleanup / style
        css: why "style="display:none; clear: none""?

* pfgQuickEdit.js
    - should pfgWidgets be merged?

* Examine new outside source (jqueryui dnd)
    - can we find something lighter-weight for drag-and-drop;
      in any case, we should avoid a "custom" module.
    
* There are some strings in the JavaScript that should be passed via
  template so that they may be translated.

* d-n-d field adding is leaving the field at the end of the list.
  was this working before js cleanup?
