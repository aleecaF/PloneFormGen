TODO.txt

When a field is deleted in the quick editor, a form field editor
briefly shows in the popup.

Plone 2.5 compatibility leftovers?
    - Do we still need to patch the ZPublisher? See method
      patch_publisher_exception_handling in patches.py
      
      After clearing out the last of the "not HAS_PLONE3" code,
      it looks like it only runs in browser.txt, but is needed
      there to keep the tests working.

Problem: The quick editor as a toggle isn't really such a great idea.
Consider the case where a form has been submitted with errors, then
the user hits the quickedit icon and begins to make changes in
the form composition. Yuck.
Steve is working on a separate quickedit view that should resolve
these problems get rid of the #qedit state mechanism.


For merge of manca's branch: these things still need checking/fixing

* fg_base_view_p3.cpt
    - after working, needs to be revisited for cleanup / style
        css: why "style="display:none; clear: none""?

* pfgQuickEdit.js
    - should pfgWidgets be merged?

* Examine new outside source (jqueryui dnd)
    - can we find something lighter-weight for drag-and-drop;
      in any case, we should avoid a "custom" module.
    
* d-n-d field adding is leaving the field at the end of the list.
  was this working before js cleanup?

* when the user d-n-d a field to the left we get this error: 
 "formElem.validator is not a function" toolbox.js(line 75)
