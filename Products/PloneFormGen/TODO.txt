TODO.txt

When a field is deleted in the quick editor, a form field editor
briefly shows in the popup.

Plone 2.5 compatibility leftovers?
    - Do we still need to patch the ZPublisher? See method
      patch_publisher_exception_handling in pathes.py
    - We shouldn't need the variable PLONE_25_PUBLISHER_MONKEYPATCH
      anymore

* fg_base_view_p3.cpt
    - after working, needs to be revisited for cleanup / style
        css: why "style="display:none; clear: none""?

* pfgQuickEdit.js
    - should pfgWidgets be merged?

* Examine new outside source (jqueryui dnd)
    - can we find something lighter-weight for drag-and-drop;
      in any case, we should avoid a "custom" module.
    
* d-n-d field adding is leaving the field at the end of the list.
  was this working before js cleanup?
