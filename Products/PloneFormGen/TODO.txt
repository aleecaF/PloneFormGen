TODO.txt

For merge of manca's branch: these things need checking/fixing

* conditions.py needs a code update
    - may be using wrong permission (in configure.zcml)
    - priority fields sorting isn't going to work in anything but English!
    - why is this a solo view class?
    - Too much work is done in template; this needs more code.
    - displayFields should return both fields and adapters in a single call
        in a tuple.
   
* fg_base_view_p3.cpt
    - why traversing to conditions?
    - after working, needs to be revisited for cleanup / style
        css: why "style="display:none; clear: none""?

* pfgQuickEdit.js
    - should pfgWidgets be merged?
    - turn into a browser resource

Examine new outside sources (validator and jqueryui dnd)
    - the validator should be in p.a.jqt
